# 100-Days-Challenge

This is my 100 days Challenge and here is why I've chosen to do to it:

1. I want to improve my programming skills
2. I want to commit to something and see it through
3. I don't want to be afraid to make mistakes anymore, therefor I will push every project, even the ugliest I've got in my directory.

My goals are:

-{ } design a responsive website without Bootstrap.
-{ } create an animated website
-{ } collaborate with a repo here in github
